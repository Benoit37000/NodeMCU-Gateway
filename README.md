NodeMCU ESP8266 Gateway
=======================

The gateway can host several funny things like

- Socket to plug a NodeMCU V1.0
- Pins to connect I2C or SPI OLED 128x64
- Pins to connect 2.2" or 1.8" TFT LCD
- RFM69 or RFM12B on board module
- Lipo Battery connector for testing and move the Gateway (no charger on board)
- 3V3 On board regulator is provided by NodeMCU Board
- Data connection for any cheap ebay ASK RX receiver
- 2 x grove I2C connector to connect other I2C devices

*Boards are in progress, I did not tested them yet, I will update as soon has I got them in my hands. Use at your own risks*

Detailed Description
====================

No specific documentation for now, but very close in term of feature to Particle Gateway I created and blogged on this dedicated [post][1]

You can order the PCB of this board at [OSHPARK][3]

### Assembled boards

I'm currently waiting for boards from OSHPARK
